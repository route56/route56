Problem Statement
    
We have a collection of strings, and we want to right justify them. Create a class Justifier that contains a method justify that is given a string[] textIn and returns a string[] containing the same strings, right justified, in the same order as they appear in textIn.
The returned strings should be padded on the left with space characters so that they are all the same length as the longest string in textIn.
Definition
    
Class:
Justifier
Method:
justify
Parameters:

string[]
Method signature:
string[] justify(string[] textIn)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
textIn will contain between 1 and 50 elements inclusive
-
each element of textIn will contain only uppercase letters 'A'-'Z'
-
each element of textIn will contain between 1 and 50 characters inclusive
Examples
0)

    
{"BOB","TOMMY","JIM"}
Returns: { "  BOB",  "TOMMY",  "  JIM" }
The longest string is "TOMMY" which has 5 characters. So the returned strings all contain exactly 5 characters.
1)

    
{"JOHN","JAKE","ALAN","BLUE"}
Returns: { "JOHN",  "JAKE",  "ALAN",  "BLUE" }
No padding is necessary since they all contain the same number of characters.
2)

    
{"LONGEST","A","LONGER","SHORT"}
Returns: { "LONGEST",  "      A",  " LONGER",  "  SHORT" }
