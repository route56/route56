
Problem Statement
    
You are given a int[] divisors containing K elements. Find a positive integer n such that exactly K-1 elements of divisors are exact divisors of n. If there are several such numbers n, return the smallest possible one. If no such number n exists, return -1 instead.
Definition
    
Class:
AllButOneDivisor
Method:
getMinimum
Parameters:
int[]
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int getMinimum(int[] divisors)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
A number x is an exact divisor of y if y divided by x yields an integer result.
-
If x is an exact divisor of y then we call y a multiple of x.
Constraints
-
divisors will contain between 2 and 6 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of divisors will be distinct.
-
Each element of divisors will be between 1 and 15, inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
{2,3,5}
Returns: 6
There are many possible values for n in this case. For example: 6, 15, 75 and 12. 6 is the smallest of them.
1)

    
{2,4,3,9}
Returns: 12

2)

    
{3,2,6}
Returns: -1
Every multiple of 3 and 2 is also a multiple of 6. Every multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 2 and 3.  Therefore, a number that is a multiple of exactly 2 out of the three elements in this array cannot exist.
3)

    
{6,7,8,9,10}
Returns: 360

4)

    
{10,6,15}
Returns: -1
