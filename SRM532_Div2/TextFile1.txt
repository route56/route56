
Problem Statement
    
Mr. Dengklek lives in the Kingdom of Ducks, where humans and ducks live together in peace and harmony. 
The ducks are numbered by distinct positive integers from A to B, inclusive, where A <= B.  

Last night, Mr. Dengklek could not sleep, so he tried to count all the ducks in the kingdom. (It is known that counting ducks can help people to fall asleep.) 

When counting the ducks, Mr. Dengklek walked across an imaginary meadow and whenever he saw a new duck, he called out its number. 

He only called out actual duck numbers, i.e., numbers from A to B. He never called the same number twice. 

The numbers he called out are not necessarily in the numeric order.  

You are given a int[] ducks. The elements of ducks are the numbers 

Mr. Dengklek called out when counting the ducks last night. 

It is possible that he missed some of the ducks. 

Obviously, the number of ducks he missed depends on the values A and B. 
The values of A and B are unknown to you. 

Compute and return the smallest possible number of ducks Mr. Dengklek might have missed.

Examples
0)

    
{5, 3, 2}
Returns: 1
If A=2 and B=5, the only duck Mr. Dengklek missed is the duck number 4.

1)

    
{58}
Returns: 0
If A=B=58, Mr. Dengklek did not miss any ducks.
2)

    
{9, 3, 6, 4}
Returns: 3
In this case, the smallest possible number of missed ducks is 3: the ducks with numbers 5, 7, and 8.
3)

    
{7, 4, 77, 47, 74, 44}
