
Problem Statement
    
Comparer-inator is a very simple language that is specialized in comparisons. It takes an expression and returns the result. There are only two kinds of expressions: a variable name or a tertiary operator inspired by C syntax (which is also used in many languages like Java, C++, and C#). We are interested to use this language to process two int[]s, A and B to generate the int[] wanted as a result. We have previously found that there are four candidate programs that could be an optimal way to solve the issue we have. Each of the programs takes two arguments a and b. 
"a" : This program will return the given argument a.
"b" : This program will return the given argument b.
"a<b?a:b" : If a is less than b, the program will return a, else it will return b.
"a<b?b:a" : If a is less than b, the program will return b, else it will return a.
 Given int[] A, B and wanted find the shortest of the four candidate programs that, for every index i, will return wanted[i] after being provided a=A[i] and b=B[i] as arguments. Return the length of the shortest program. If no candidate program can do the required job, return -1 instead.
Definition
    
Class:
ComparerInator
Method:
makeProgram
Parameters:
int[], int[], int[]
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int makeProgram(int[] A, int[] B, int[] wanted)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-

-
Each element of A, B and wanted will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
{1}
{2}
{2}
Returns: 1
"b" and "a<b?b:a" (quotes for clarity) are the two programs that will return 2 after being given a=1, b=2 as arguments. "b" is the shortest of them.
1)

    
{1,3}
{2,1}
{2,3}
Returns: 7
"a<b?b:a" is the only program that will return 2 after being provided a=1, b=2 and will also return 3 after being provided a=3, b=1.
2)

    
{1,3,5}
{2,1,7}
{2,3,5}
Returns: -1
None of the four programs can do the job correctly.
3)

    
{1,3,5}
{2,1,7}
{1,3,5}
Returns: 1

4)

    
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
{5,4,7,8,3,1,1,2,3,4,6}
{1,2,3,4,3,1,1,2,3,4,6}
Returns: 7

5)

    
{1,5,6,7,8}
{1,5,6,7,8}
{1,5,6,7,8}
Returns: 1
"a", "b", "a<b?a:b" and "a<b?b:a" are all valid programs that will give the wanted result. "a" and "b" are the shortest.
